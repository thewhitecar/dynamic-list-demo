## Dynamic List

For a project I'm working on, I needed to create a dynamic list of select menus.  As a user makes their initial selection, a new select menu appears with their selection removed as an option.  A third menu appears, this time with both selections removed from the menu.

When I was looking for resources on building something like this, I unfortunately did not find much! So we decided to make this repo to help other developers build this on their own.  Hopefully this helps someone somewhere!
